# Clue

Clue is a Swift library, and a command-line tool that finds symbol references in Swift projects.

Like Xcode, finding references of a symbol with Clue can be fairly straightforward. Unlike Xcode, Clue exposes controls that fine tune its behavior, so that an expert can find the code references they need 100% of the time.

(Hopefully, it isn't hard to become an expert user!)
